# Themes
## Looking pretty good!

Titan Embeds has a selection of pre-built themes you may use for your embed. These themes are fully compatible with custom CSS and approved by Titan's developers. As of August 2018, these themes include:

* BetterTitan
* DiscordDark
* [FireWyvern](https://titanembeds.com/static/themes/FireWyvern/promo/promo.png)
* [IceWyvern](https://titanembeds.com/static/themes/IceWyvern/promo/promo.png)
* MetroEdge

You can select a theme for your embed by using the ``theme`` query parameter. It's used as follows:
```theme=<ThemeName>```.
You have to replace ``<ThemeName>`` with the name of the theme you would like to use, for example: ``theme=FireWyvern``. Query parameters get appended to the end of your embed's URL like so: ``https://titanembeds.com/embed/295085744249110529?theme=FireWyvern``.

# Demo

You may demo this [here](https://titanembeds.com/embed/295085744249110529?theme=FireWyvern). The Fire Wyvern theme is used in this instance, but you may replace the ``theme`` query parameter's value with another one to see what you like.
