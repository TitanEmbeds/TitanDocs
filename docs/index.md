Titan allows you to embed Discord onto your web site. This wiki will provide you all the resources you need to get the most out of your embed. In case you're interested, you can create your embed for free on the Titan Embeds website. If you need help with that, read up on "First time setup".

For additional support, [visit our Discord server](https://discord.io/Titan).
