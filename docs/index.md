## What is Titan Embeds?
You don't know? Well, let me tell you a story.

In the beginning, there was **silence**.

[People](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/3tucod/embedding_discord_via_iframe_disabled/) [like](https://feedback.discordapp.com/forums/326712-discord-dream-land/suggestions/10821381-please-turn-back-on-iframe-embed-for-discord-chat) [you](https://feedback.discordapp.com/forums/326712-discord-dream-land/suggestions/18454222-embed-in-forum-chat-option) would **love** to embed their Discord server on webpages, but there simply were no options to do such thing!  

Well, say no more, for we introduce to you...

[![Titan Embeds](https://github.com/TitanEmbeds/Titan/raw/master/webapp/titanembeds/static/img/titanembeds.png)](https://titanembeds.com)

...a unique, stripped down version of your Discord server, embeddable on any webpages alike!

There was a time when Discord didn't support embedding the chat on a webpage. One had to resort to extreme measures to ensure they did not break the cross origin policy that Discord is enforcing, which resulted in many very sad outcomes. Many users have complained that Discord's own embeddable widget does not include the chat itself. What is the point of embedding Discord without chat?

This is where **Titan** steps in. By inviting the Titan bot into your server, it can act like a proxy where it relays chat from your website embed to the Discord server. You will be given a unique URL/iframe code to paste directly onto your website.

It just doesn't ends here! Titan is jam-packed with many features, such as guest users as well as allowing Discord users to participate. Guest users will be treated similar to users without a role. Discord users, however, will inherit their own permission abilities. The client itself is designed with flexibility. It looks good in websites of all taste!

Please note that Titan should not be used as a replacement for Discord. It is meant to be run alongside it.
