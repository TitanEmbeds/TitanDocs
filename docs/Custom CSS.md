# Custom CSS
## Straight to the dark side, huh?

Titan Embeds has support for custom CSS. This enables you make the embed look how you want it to be. You can use it to make the embed fit with your site's theme, for example. If you don't know about CSS, this might not be for you. In that case, we recommend you to take a look at our pre-built themes instead.

## Obtaining CSS slots

Before you can start implementing your custom CSS, you first need to obtain a so called "CSS slot". Each slot allows you to upload your custom CSS code to it. There are two ways of obtaining a CSS slot.
* A free CSS slot given by an administrator, which can be obtained by asking one on the Titan Embeds Discord server.
* A CSS slot you bought with Titan Tokens, which can be obtained by donating through PayPal or Patreon.
After you have obtained a CSS slot, it will show up on your dashboard.

**Warning: Your custom CSS code is not private! If someone really wanted to, they will be able to see it!**

## Assigning a CSS slot to an embed

Each CSS slot has a unique CSS ID assigned to it. It can be found in the CSS editor for the particular slot you would like to use.

You need to use the CSS query parameter with your CSS ID appended to your embed's URL to assign it. If you don't, your embed will load without you custom CSS. Links with and without the CSS query parameter with different CSS IDs may be used interchangeably if so desired.

## That's great and all, but how does CSS even work?

CSS has so many options that all of its capabilities could never be properly explained in just one wiki page. Great free sources where these are fully explained include [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css) and others.

## I already yield all of CSS' precious powers. To what extent am I allowed to leverage it?

In general, you may do what ever you want with it except using it to track people. This includes, but is not limited to, collecting information like IP addresses and browser info by including things like web beacons to your code. You may remove Titan Embeds' branding but a mention somewhere else on the page you will use the embed on would be greatly appreciated.
