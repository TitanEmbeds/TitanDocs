# Custom CSS

Straight to the dark side, huh? Titan Embeds has support for custom CSS. This enables you make the embed look how you want it to be. You can use it to make the embed fit with your site's theme, for example. If you don't know about CSS, this might not be for you. In that case, we recommend you to take a look at our pre-built themes instead.

## Obtaining CSS slots

Before you can start implementing your custom CSS, you first need to obtain a so called "CSS slot". Each slot allows you to upload your custom CSS code to it. There are two ways of obtaining a CSS slot.
* A free CSS slot given by an administrator, which can be obtained by asking one on the Titan Embeds Discord server.
* A CSS slot you bought with Titan Tokens, which can be obtained by donating through PayPal or Patreon.
After you have obtained a CSS slot, it will show up on your dashboard.

!!! warning
    Your custom CSS code is not private! If someone really wanted to, they will be able to see it.

## Assigning a CSS slot to an embed

Each CSS slot has a unique CSS ID assigned to it. It can be found in the CSS editor for the particular slot you would like to use.

You need to use the CSS query parameter with your CSS ID appended to your embed's URL to assign it. If you don't, your embed will load without you custom CSS. Links with and without the CSS query parameter with different CSS IDs may be used interchangeably if so desired.

## How CSS works

Great, I know, but how does CSS work? It has so many options that one page wouldn't really be enough to do it any justice. If you would like to know more, great free sources where include [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css) and others.

## What am I allowed to use CSS for?

All of CSS' precious powers you wield, though we'd be pleas'd if thou shan't use it for evil. In general, you may do what ever you want with it except using it to track people. This includes, but is not limited to, collecting information like IP addresses and browser info by including things like web beacons to your code. You may remove Titan Embeds' branding but a mention somewhere else on the page you will use the embed on would be greatly appreciated.
