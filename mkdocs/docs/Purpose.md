# Explain me your purpose

Well, we don't know either. Just kidding, Titan Embeds is a unique, stripped down version of your Discord server, embeddable on any webpages alike!

# What's teh LORE

There was a time when embedding your Discord chat on a webpage a web page was not possible. One must go into extreme measures to ensure that they do not break the Cross Origin policy that Discord client is enforcing, which resulted in many very sad outcomes. Many users have also complained that the Discord's built-in widget does not include the chat itself. What is the point of embedding Discord without chat?!

Titan is a project that aims to create an embeddable link for your Discord servers. Upon adding our friend, @Titan, to your server, you will be given an Iframe code which you can paste to your website's HTML editor. Users browsing your website may use the Titan client as a shoutbox, for example. With Titan, you can have either guest accounts or login using Discord to chat on your server. With visitor view enabled, your website's visitors may see how active your Discord server is. No need to keep Discord open all the time! Titan is a by-product from [BronyTV](http://www.bronytv.net/about) and their decision to move away from the IRC into the modern platform of Discord. Without them, this project wouldn't even exist!

# Wow, this might actually be a cool lil' project!
