# 你喜欢用你不懂的语言阅读文字吗？
Yeah, me neither. Luckily, thanks to all of our awesome translators over on [Crowdin](http://translate.titanembeds.com/project/titanembeds), Titan Embeds is available in multiple languages! By default, your embed will automatically select a language based on the user's browser settings. This feature should perfectly integrate with any multilingual sites. The following languages are available as of August 2018:

* Catalan (Català) [ca_ES]
* Czech (čeština) [cs_CZ]
* Danish (Dansk) [da_DK]
* German (Deutsch) [de_DE]
* English (English) [en_US]
* Spanish (Español) [es_ES]
* French (français) [fr_FR]
* Hindi (हिंदी) [hi_IN]
* Hungarian (Magyar) [hu_HU]
* Indonesian (bahasa Indonesia) [id_ID]
* Italian (Italiano) [it_IT]
* Japanese (日本語) [ja_JP]
* Dutch (Nederlands) [nl_NL]
* Polish (Polski) [pl_PL]
* Portuguese (Português) [pt_PT]
* Romanian (Română) [ro_RO]
* Slovenian (Slovenščina) [sl_SI]
* Serbian (Cyrillic) (Српски) [sr_Cyrl]
* Serbian (Latin) (Српски) [sr_Latn]
* Swedish (svenska) [sv_SE]
* Thai (ไทย) [th_TH]
* Turkish (Türk) [tr_TR]
* Chinese Simplified (简体中文) [zh_Hans_CN]
* Chinese Traditional (中国传统的) [zh_Hant_TW]

The translators for each language are credited on [Titan Embeds' about page](https://titanembeds.com/about). Translators that are member of our Discord server can be recognised by their translator role.

# I don't want my embed to automatically select a language

You can force the embed to use a specific language by appending a query paramater at the end of your embed's URL. In this case, you should use: ``lang=<language>``. For example, if you'd like to force the embed to, say, use the Dutch language, the query parameter should look like this: ``lang=nl_NL``. If you did everything correctly, your link should look similar to this one: ``https://titanembeds.com/embed/295085744249110529?lang=nl_NL``. Dat is handig!
