# @Titan, make me coffee

Okay, maybe not. You probably already had way too much anyways. This page will describe what you can make Titan do by using commands. After [having the bot added to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=299403260031139840&scope=bot&permissions=641195117), you will be able to make her do whatever you want.

# @Titan, what can you do?

You can use the following commands with the Titan bot on your server. Every command is preceded by tagging the bot using ``@Titan#7689``.

Command | Description
--- | ---
``invite`` | Replies with an OAuth URL used to invite the bot to your server
``members`` | Replies with a list of members logged into your Titan Embed.
``server`` | Replies with an instant invite to the Titan Embeds support server.
``help`` | Replies with a list of helpful links to get going.

Titan can also ban or kick guest users. For each of the following commands, the username does not need to be a full string and the discriminator is optional.

Command | Description
--- | ---
``ban <username>`` | Bans the user by the username.
``kick <username>`` | Kicks the user by the username.

# @Titan, is that all you can do?

By [managing the server from your dashboard](https://titanembeds.com/user/dashboard) after logging in with your Discord account, you will be able to more in-depth than just these commands. In case the dashboard still isn't enough for you, you may also use query parameters to further customise your Titan Embeds experience.
